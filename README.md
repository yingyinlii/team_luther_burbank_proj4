## 1. Project Topic & Goal:
Our project aims to analyze the food demand system in Panama, evaluate the nutritional composition of various food items, and assess the nutritional sufficiency of households in Panama. Key objectives include establishing criteria for essential nutrients, identifying prevalent nutritional deficiencies, and examining challenges faced by Panamanian households in meeting recommended dietary intakes.

Preliminary findings suggest that a significant portion of Panamanian households exhibit deficiencies in essential nutrients such as vitamin A, vitamin C, and fiber, with a notable percentage failing to meet recommended daily intake levels. Additionally, there are concerns regarding excess carbohydrate consumption among certain households, which may lead to health issues such as caloric surplus and nutrient imbalances.

## 2. Policy Exploration:
Our proposed policies are designed to enhance the nutritional quality of Panamanian households by focusing on achieving vitamin and fiber sufficiency in two-thirds of the population. Strategies include:
- Implementing food stamp programs or subsidies to reduce the cost of high-vitamin and high-fiber foods, especially fruits and vegetables.
- Providing subsidies to local restaurants contingent upon incorporating a minimum of 70% items rich in vitamins and fiber into their menus.
- Introducing tax incentives for farmers engaged in the production of fiber-rich foods to promote cultivation and availability.

## 3. Data(set) Description:
### Main DataSet - Panama Dataset:
- **Household Characteristics:** Provides detailed household composition data from various provinces in Panama spanning the years 1997 to 2008.
- **FCT (Food Composition Table):** Offers a comprehensive overview of the nutritional content of different foods per 100 grams of edible portion.
- **Food Expenditures:** Features information on food expenditure across diverse households, organized by year, region, and household identifier.
- **Food Prices:** Comprises a collection of food items alongside their prices and measurements across different regions and time periods in Panama.
- **RDI (Recommended Dietary Intake):** Outlines recommended daily intake levels of various nutrients for different age and gender groups.
